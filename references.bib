	abstract = {Neutrino oscillation experiments presently suggest that neutrinos have a small but finite mass. If neutrinos have mass, there should be a Lorentz frame in which they can be brought to rest. This paper discusses how Wigner’s little groups can be used to distinguish between massive and massless particles. We derive a representation of the SL(2,c) group which separates out the two sets of spinors: one set is gauge dependent and the other set is gauge invariant and represents polarized neutrinos. We show that a similar calculation can be done for the Dirac equation. In the large-momentum/zero-mass limit, the Dirac spinors can be separated into large and small components. The large components are gauge invariant, while the small components are not. These small components represent spin-1/2 non-zero-mass particles. If we renormalize the large components, these gauge invariant spinors represent the polarization of neutrinos. Massive neutrinos cannot be invariant under gauge transformations.},

	abstract = {As the most advantageous total hip arthroplasty (THA) operation is the first, timely replacement of only the liner is socially and economically important because the utilization of THA is increasing as younger and more active patients are receiving implants and they are living longer. Automatic algorithms were developed to infer liner wear by estimating the separation between the acetabular cup and femoral component head given a computed tomography (CT) volume. Two series of CT volumes of a hip phantom were acquired with the femoral component head placed at 14 different positions relative to the acetabular cup. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the diameter of the acetabular cup and femoral component head, in addition to the range of error in the expected wear values and the repeatability of all the measurements, were calculated. The algorithms resulted in a mean (±SD) for the diameter of the acetabular cup of 54.21 (±0.011) mm and for the femoral component head of 22.09 (±0.02) mm. The wear error was ±0.1 mm and the repeatability was 0.077 mm. This approach is applicable clinically as it utilizes readily available computed tomography imaging systems and requires only five minutes of human interaction.},

	doi = {10.1108/14684521211254068},
	abstract = {Purpose
              The aim of this research is to define a data model of theses and dissertations that enables data exchange with CERIF‐compatible CRIS systems and data exchange according to OAI‐PMH protocol in different metadata formats (Dublin Core, EDT‐MS, etc.).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Various systems that contain metadata about theses and dissertations are analyzed. There are different standards and protocols that enable the interoperability of those systems: CERIF standard, AOI‐PMH protocol, etc. A physical data model that enables interoperability with almost all of those systems is created using the PowerDesigner CASE tool.
            
            
              Findings
              A set of metadata about theses and dissertations that contain all the metadata required by CERIF data model, Dublin Core format, EDT‐MS format and all the metadata prescribed by the University of Novi Sad is defined. Defined metadata can be stored in the CERIF‐compatible data model based on the MARC21 format.
            
            
              Practical implications
              CRIS‐UNS is a CRIS which has been developed at the University of Novi Sad since 2008. The system is based on the proposed data model, which enables the system's interoperability with other CERIF‐compatible CRIS systems. Also, the system based on the proposed model can become a member of NDLTD.
            
            
              Social implications
              A system based on the proposed model increases the availability of theses and dissertations, and thus encourages the development of the knowledge‐based society.
            
            
              Originality/value
              A data model of theses and dissertations that enables interoperability with CERIF‐compatible CRIS systems is proposed. A software system based on the proposed model could become a member of NDLTD and exchange metadata with institutional repositories. The proposed model increases the availability of theses and dissertations.},

PacketMill grinds the whole packet processing stack, from the high-level network function configuration file to the low-level userspace network (specifically DPDK) drivers, to mitigate inefficiencies and produce a customized binary for a given network function. Our evaluation results show that PacketMill increases throughput (up to 36.4 Gbps -- 70\%) \& reduces latency (up to 101 us -- 28\%) and enables nontrivial packet processing (e.g., router) at ~100 Gbps, when new packets arrive >10\texttimes{} faster than main memory access times, while using only one processing core.},

    <p>This is the artifact for the “PacketMill: Toward per-core 100-Gbps Networking” paper published at ASPLOS’21.</p>
<p>PacketMill is a system that optimizes the performance of network functions via holistic inter-stack optimizations. More specifically, PacketMill provides a new metadata management model, called X-Change, enabling the packet processing frameworks to provide their custom buffer to DPDK and fully bypass rte_mbuf. Additionally, PacketMill performs a set of source-code \& intermediate representation (IR) code optimizations.</p>
<p>Our paper’s artifact contains the source code, the experimental workflow, and additional information to (i) set upPacketMill \& its testbed, (ii) perform some of the experiments presented in the paper, and (iii) validates the reusability \& effectiveness of PacketMill.</p>

   abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) studies acquired in list mode offer the opportunity to provide a cine loop showing the dynamics of 18F- PET uptake, giving a visualization of regional bone remodeling. The focus of this report is a group of patients treated with Taylor spatial frames (TSF). The studies were acquired for a period of 45 minutes and saved in list mode. The list was decoded and subsequently segmented into time intervals of one minute each. For each time interval a sinogram was generated from which volumes of one minute each were reconstructed. Slices projected from these volumes could then be displayed as a dynamic loop superimposed on the corresponding computed tomography (CT) slice in order to visualize the 18F- uptake insitu. It was indicated that this technique has the potential of becoming an additional technique to that of using static volumes and SUV values only. As the list mode data was decoded it also offered a method to evaluate the potential decrease in injected activity by eliminating every Nth event from the list before reconstructing the 45 minute volume. This was done and the indication was that the injected activity and hence the effective dose to the patient can be decreased. However, in this work, this was not proven clinically. The open source STIR software was used to reconstruct volumes from sinograms to enable an unlimited access to reconstructing volumes without disturbing the daily routine at the clinic. The data was acquired on a clinical Siemens Medical Solutions Biograph 64 TruePoint TrueV, PET/CT scanner situated at the Nuclear Medicine Department at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. This scanner was not supported by the STIR software, hence the data collected by the Siemens PET/CT scanner was translated so that 3D reconstructions could be computed using the STIR tools. The reconstructions made in STIR resulted in volumes of sufficient visual quality, but not as good as those reconstructed by the scanner itself. Further optimization in STIR was left for future work. According to the physicians who treat these patients, dynamic visualization was of sufficient interest to continue to develop and optimize this method. The cine loops that were presented to the physicians were made from JPEG slices produced from the one minute volumes and put together as GIF files. It was also possible to vary the reconstruction time (from uniformly one minute) as well as the presentation rate in the cine loop, but this was left for future work. Ultimately, the cine loop will be implemented in the locally developed software tool. },

   abstract = {Since the approval of the IEEE 802.11b by the IEEE in 1999, the demand for WLAN equipment and networks has been growing quickly. We present a queuing model of wireless LAN (WLAN) access points (APs) for IEEE 802.11b. We use experimentation to obtain the characteristic parameters of our analytic model. The model can be used to compare the performance of different WLAN APs as well as the QoS of different applications in the presence of an AP. We focus on the delay introduced by an AP. The major observations are that the delay to serve a packet going from the WLAN medium to the wired medium (on the uplink) is less than the delay to serve a packet, with identical payload, but travelling from the wired medium to the WLAN medium (on the downlink). A key result is an analytic solution showing that the average service time of a packet is a strictly increasing function of payload.},
